Windows 12? Hudson Valley compatibility checker

This app performs an early preview check regarding hardware compatibility with the new Windows 12 Germanium, also known as the Hudson Valley user experience platform. CPU support relies on the current lists provided by Microsoft for Windows 11 and will be expanded accordingly as new specifications become available. Please note that I also do not have any information regarding a potential Windows 12 release this year, and the check may not yet provide accurate results.
